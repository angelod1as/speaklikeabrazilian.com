  - definition: "Okay, this one can be very handy. Literally translating, it would be \"Shitting and walking\". But the meaning, is similar to \"Water off a duck's back\".\n\nThere's a pun with those Yogurts the makes your intestines work better and Johnnie Walker, as one makes you shit, and the other says to keep walking.\n\nIt is used to demonstrate that you don''t care about something."
    example: "- Ow, [c\u00ea] ouviu o que eles [t\u00e3o] falando de voc\u00ea?\n- [Bah], [t\u00f4] cagando e andando mano."
