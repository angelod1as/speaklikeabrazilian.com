  - definition: "It translates to \"eat until (it) will pout\". This expression must be used informally, but it has a double-meaning. Most people don't realize that the \"it\" in the expression is sometimes replaced by \"o cu\", as in \"comer at\u00e9 o cu fazer bico\".\r\n\r\nThe origin of the expression comes actually from this slang. It means that you will eat so much, but so much, that you'll be filled, and your ass will start to pout. Gross, I know.\r\n\r\nSome people might say too, that you'll actually pout your lips, in a sign that you are full and cannot eat anymore."
    example: "- Voc\u00ea viu o que a m\u00e3e do Al\u00ea fez? Bife acebolado!\r\n- [Nuossa]! [V\u00f4] comer at\u00e9 fazer bico!"
