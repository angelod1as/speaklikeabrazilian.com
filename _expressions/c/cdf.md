  - definition: "CDF is a person with very high grade at school/university. It stands for C\u00fa De Ferro, or literally iron ass. Probably due to the fact of staying many hours seated studying. \n\nThe old expression for CDF is \"[caxias](/c/caxias/)\", and is still used by older people or in some places in Brazil."
    example: "- O Fabr\u00edcio \u00e9 o mais inteligente da sala!\n- Eu sei, ele sempre foi o maior CDF."
