      The literal translation makes no sense, as it means “chayote beauty”. The actual meaning is
      “OK”, “cool”, “awesome”. It is an expression to show enthusiasm and confirm something is looking
      good. Can also be used as a greeting. This expression may sound outdated.
    example: |
      - Oi, tudo bom?
      - **Chuchu beleza**, e você [truta](/u/truta/)?
