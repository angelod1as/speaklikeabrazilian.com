      This expression translates in English to “kick the bucket”, but it has a different meaning
      in Portuguese: to give up, to desist, to let it go. This is normally used when someone
      cannot take anymore and just give up.
    example: |
      - Ela não aguentava mais ele, daí um dia ela simplesmente **chutou o balde**, pegou as coisas dela e foi embora.
