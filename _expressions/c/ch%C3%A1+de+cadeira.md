  - definition: "You can give a \"ch\u00e1 de caidera\" on someone, or get a \"ch\u00e1 de cadeira\" from someone.\r\n\r\nWhen you give it to someone, it means that you made someone else to wait for a long time. Likewise, when you get one, means that you had to wait for a long time for something or someone."
    example: "- Vai tirar o visto pros Estados Unidos?\r\n- Vou sim, amanh\u00e3 \u00e0s tr\u00eas da tarde.\r\n- Xi, se prepara pra tomar um ch\u00e1 de cadeira, hein?!"
