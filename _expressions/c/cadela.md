        A pejorative term, with a meaning similar to the word "bitch" in English.
        
        In English, "bitch" is an offensive word, but its original meaning was female dog. In Portuguese
        the normal translation for "bitch" is "puta". It is rarely associated with its other possible translation
        for a female dog.

        - Eu acho que a esposa do Henrique [tá](/t/tá/) dando em cima do meu namorado!
        - Que cadela!
