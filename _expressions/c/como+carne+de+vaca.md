  - definition: "It translates to \"like cow meat\", and is used to denote that something is very common, or can be easily find somewhere. Is has the same meaning as 'run of the mill'.\n\nIn Brazil cow meat is very common, as well as chicken and pig. So probably that explains the meaning and use of this expression."
    example: "- Nossa! Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 viu uma jaqueta com esse tecido?!\n- Ah, isso \u00e9 como carne de vaca l\u00e1 na minha terra."
