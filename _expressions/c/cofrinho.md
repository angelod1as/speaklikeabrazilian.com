  - definition: "Buttcrack. \n\nThere are jokes on this too, because cofrinho is also how we call piggy banks. So when someone sleeps on his chair and you spot his/her cofrinho, some people drop coins in there.\n\nYou can either say \"mostrar o cofrinho\" (show the buttcrack), or \"pagar cofrinho\" (pay? buttcrack). Both expressions mean that you are displaying your buttcrack."
    example: "- [T\u00e1] pagando cofrinho [man\u00e9]!\n- \u00c9 meu! Que que tem?"
