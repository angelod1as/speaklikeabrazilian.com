  - definition: "\"Gambiarras\" are workarounds, or improvisations that people do to overcome problems. Like when you have no power adapter and you build your own with staples and paper clips. Probably the gambiarra champion is MacGyver."
    example: "- Oh n\u00e3o! A impressora quebrou.\n- N\u00e3o se preocupe. Me d\u00ea um clipes, uma cenoura e dois palitos de dentes que arrumo.\n- Que gambiarra!"
