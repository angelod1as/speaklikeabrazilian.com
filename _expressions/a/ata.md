  - definition: "When someone say something and you don't care. Sounds kinda ironic.\r\nCan also be used to represent that you don't believe what was said. \r\n\r\n\"Ata\" is different from \"Ah, t\u00e1\"\r\n\"Ah, t\u00e1\" just means you understand."
    example: "1-\r\n- A Maria vai no parque amanh\u00e3.\r\n- Ata\r\n\r\n2-\r\n- Eu gosto dele.\r\n- ATA\r\n"
