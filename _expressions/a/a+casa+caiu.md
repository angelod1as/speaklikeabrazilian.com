      Similar to “já era”, “perdeu”, and “deu zebra”. This description of a house falling
      apart means that something went wrong or is hopeless.
    
      This is something a police officer entering a room full of drug dealers could shout.
      On the other hand, the drug dealers could also say the same thing after they are busted
      by the cops.
    example: |
      - Já era [mané](/m/mané), **a casa caiu**! Todo mundo mão na cabeça!
      
      - Ih, acho que **a casa caiu** pro Alberto do 203. Parece que a namorada
      dele achou algumas mensagens no celular dele…
