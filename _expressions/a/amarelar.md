      It means to **give up** on something, to **chicken out**. Used in
      sports when one team is said to have lost for they were intimidated by the other team,
      or in a fight when one fighter loses and lost spirit during the fight.
      
      But can also be used in everyday situations. Like when someone wants to go talk to a
      man or woman in a bar, but gives up. Friends might say the other person **amarelou**.
    example: |
      - Ih, você não ia até lá pedir aumento pro seu chefe?
      - Ah, amarelei. Eu vi a porta aberta mas não tive coragem...
