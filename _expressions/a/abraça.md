      It literally means to ask someone to hug or embrace something. There was an old expression
      where it was used with “idéia” (idea), as in **abraça essa idéia**. But nowadays it is
      normally found by itself, and with a sarcastic tone.
      
      It is used when the person using it does not agree with a situation. Similar to
      “oh, sure”, or “oh! of course”, but with sarcasm, expressing nonsatisfaction and
      indignation. 
    example: |
      - Ih, o chefe falou que ele quer o time todo fazendo hora-extra esta semana…
      - Ah, **abraça**! Até parece. Eu tenho vida, e não sou obrigado a fazer hora-extra!
      
      - Quer sair comigo esse final de semana?
      - Abraça! Acha que saio com alguém como você!?
