        An old expression, not very common nowadays. Has the same meaning as
        [eles que são brancos que se entendam](/e/eles+que+são+brancos+que+se+entendam/).
        It means that a problem belongs to a certain group of people, so others
        will not get involved.
        
        It can be used, for example, if there is a very serious problem in a company,
        but it can only be solved by management level. Any technician could use this
        expression when asked about the problem.
        
        Or even if parent were discussing something and another person asked their
        kid about it. The kid could also say that.
    example: |
        - Você sabe alguma coisa sobre o projeto que atrasou do financeiro?
        - Ah, você sabe que urubu pelado não se mete no meio dos coroados né? Boa sorte pra eles, mas eu não vou me envolver não.
