  - definition: "Ass, buttocks. You can say bumbum too, but bunda is a bit more man-lish way of saying so. For instance, if you are talking with a child, probably you'd use bumbum, but if you are talking with your lads at the pub, you'd go with bunda."
    example: "- N\u00f4 [mano](/m/mano/)! \u00d3 que rab\u00e3o!\n- Caraca! Que bunda!"
