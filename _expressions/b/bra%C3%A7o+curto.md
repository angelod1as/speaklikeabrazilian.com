  - definition: "Bra\u00e7o curto translates to \"short arm\".  That's someone who doesn't like working; a lazy person. \r\n\r\nYou know that person that has always an excuse for not doing something, the laziest person in the office? He is a \"bra\u00e7o curto\". "
    example: "- Quem tomou todo o caf\u00e9 e n\u00e3o fez mais? \r\n- O Jo\u00e3o, claro. Ele \u00e9 maior bra\u00e7o curto.\r\n\r\n- Ow bra\u00e7o curto, vem c\u00e1 e me ajuda com isso."
