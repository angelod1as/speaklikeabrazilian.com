  - definition: |
      A word that is not formal, though it exists in the dictionary. The dictionary definition is for a small
      store, that sells dairy and alcohol in poor suburbs. It is used in daily conversation as a replacement
      for **thing** (coisa). So it can be used to designate anything.
      
      Even though it has a similar meaning to "thing", it has a more pejorative aspect. You wouldn't use it
      for a nice car, or nice clothes, but you would use it for a horrible car, some gadget that doesn't
      appear to be useful, or even an ugly building.
    example: |
      - Que **birosca** é isso?
      - O Davidson [tá](/t/tá/) juntando elástico ao redor desse tubo de ferro pra depois fazer máscaras.
      
      - [Tá](/t/tá/) pronto o jantar amor.
      - Que **birosca** é isso? Te fiz alguma coisa?
