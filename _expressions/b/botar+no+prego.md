      In the old times, stores used to keep tabs for known customers.
      The tabs were normally paper pieces with the name of the person
      or family.
      
      Near the cashier, the owner of the shop would have a wall with
      many of these paper tabs stuck with nails. That's where the
      expression "botar no prego" comes from, meaning to put
      on somebody's tab.
    example: |
      - São mil cruzeiros José.
      - **Bota no prego** Tião. Recebo na sexta-feira e venho pagar.
