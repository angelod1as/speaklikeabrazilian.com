  - definition: "\"Beleza\" literally means \"Beauty\". As in ''Sua beleza me encanta. A sua voz e o teu calor!''. \n\nHowever, it is very likely that you will hear more often \"Beleza\" being used with similar meaning to \"Okay\", \"Okeydokey\", \"Cool\" or as \"How are you doing?\"."
    example: "- [Eae], beleza? (Yo, how's it going?)"
