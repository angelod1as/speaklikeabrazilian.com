  - definition: "It can refer to a) a Mango Tree (mangueira in Portuguese, or [p\u00e9 de](/p/p%C3%A9+de/) manga too), b) to the famous carioca Samba School, Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Primeira de Mangueira (aka Mangueira), or yet to c) a hose. It really depends on the context."
    example: "- Voc\u00ea vai na mangueira hoje a noite? (probably the samba school, since not a lot of people go to mango trees at night... I believe; and since a hose here wouldn't make any sense)"
