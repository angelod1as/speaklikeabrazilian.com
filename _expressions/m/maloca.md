  - definition: |
      An old, shabby house. Similar to the houses in a slum. When used in this sense,
      the word does not necessarily have a pejorative meaning. It has a special meaning
      for people of the community that live there. But it is not used in professional,
      or formal environments.
    example: |
      - Saudosa **maloca**, **maloca** querida<br/>
        Dim-dim donde nós passemos os dias feliz de nossa vida
        (from the song "[Saudosa Maloca](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudosa_Maloca)" by Adoniran Barbosa)

      A place like a garden, house, or room that is in a mess. For example, in Hollywood
      movies, those houses where meth is produced that have scraps of food, clothes, old
      wall-papers peeling off the walls can be called a "maloca". 
    example: |
      - Nossa, ontem fomos fazer trabalho na casa do Pedro, e o quarto dele é a maior maloca.
