      An informal expression that means “OK”, “Sweet”, “Great job”. It transmits a positive
      meaning.

      “É nóis” is a misspelling of “é nós”, which in itself is also grammatically
      incorrect as the verb would have to be in the plural (i.e. “somos nós”). But
      the grammatically correct version also does not make much sense translating.
      
      In São Paulo this expression is commonly used in rap and hip hop songs, and
      in the outskirts of the city. When texting it can also be written as “Eh nois”.
    example: |
      - E aquele favor que te pedi ontem? Conseguiu fazer?
      - Claro!
      - **É nóis**!
