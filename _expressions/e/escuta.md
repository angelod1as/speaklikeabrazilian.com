      Asking someone to **listen up**. Not usually meaning that someone wants the other person to listen
      anything, but rather to call someone else's attention.
      
      A very common variation is **escuta aqui**, though this has a stronger impact, and normally is used
      to start an argument or discussion.
    example: |
      - Escuta, vocÃª sabe onde a Marina foi?
