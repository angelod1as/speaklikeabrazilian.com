      This expression is used to describe something that is not new. It could
      be something that has been happening since the beginning of the times,
      since a country was created, since a building was constructed, since a
      school opened, since a relationship started, or just for a long time.
    example: |
      - Pegaram o João Vitor vendendo sem nota fiscal.
      - Ih, mas isso não é de hoje. Todo mundo sabe que ele nunca pagou imposto.
