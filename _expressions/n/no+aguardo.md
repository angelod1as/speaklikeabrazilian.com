      A common expression in formal calls and emails, normally ending a conversation.
      It indicates that the speaker will be waiting for something to happen, or for a reply.
      Similar to the "looking forward to" expression in English. Not very common in conversational speech.
    example: |
      - Olá Sr. Danilo, gostaria de confirmar minha presença no evento de amanhã. Poderia
        confirmar o recebimento deste e-mail e a minha inscrição no event, por favor? Fico **no
        aguardo**. Obrigado, Rogério.
