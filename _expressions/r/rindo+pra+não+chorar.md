      Quite old expression, but very popular and still in use. Its literal translation would be
      "laughing so I don't cry". And that's pretty much the meaning of this expression.
      
      You use it when you want to say that something bad happened, but you are trying to think
      positive, or that there is nothing that you can do to fix it. 
    example: |
      - Sério que sua casa foi atingida pela enchente de ontem?
      - Uhum. Agora a gente tá rindo pra não chorar né. Perdemos todos os móveis do térreo. Salvou só
      cama, roupa, e algumas TVs.
