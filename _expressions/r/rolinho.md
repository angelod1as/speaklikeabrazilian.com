      A "nutmeg" in soccer. It is normally used with verbs such as "dar" or "levar".
      When you are the one doing a nutmeg, you are "dando um rolinho". When you are
      on the other side, it is "levar um rolinho".
      
      Rolinho is the diminutive of "rolo" (a coil, roll, rolling pin). But in soccer
      "rolo" is never used, only "rolinho".
    example: |
      - O Robinho deu dois **rolinhos** e chutou pro gol!
