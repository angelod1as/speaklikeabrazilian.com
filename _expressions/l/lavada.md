      When found in a text, you need to make sure it is a noun, for this expression. Otherwise,
      it could be just the past tense of the verb “lavar” (e.g. a camisa foi lavada).
      
      As a noun, **lavada** means a win by a very large or humiliating score. It could be
      used if a team like Germany beats Brazil for a humiliating score. In that case, that
      would have been a **lavada**.
      
      It is normally used with team sports, like soccer, or volley ball. It would be strange
      if someone used in a Judo fight to say that a fighter won against the other by a
      **lavada**. It wouldn't sound natural.
      
      However, it may be used as a figure of speech in another context, such as a business
      project that was delivered well beyond everyone's expectation. You could say that it
      was a **lavada**, although there are probably better expressions, and it could sound
      strange depending on the context and audience.
    example: |
      - Quanto foi o jogo de ontem?
      - Ah [mano](/m/mano/), nem te conto. Foi uma **lavada** pros [caras](/c/cara/).
      
      - O time da casa tomou uma **lavada** ontem.
