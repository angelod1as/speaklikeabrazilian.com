  - definition: "One could argue that a good translation is \"starvation\", but this word became popular with the pot-heads. It is the same as \"munchies\". You can use it while you are with some lads in a pub, but you can''t use it in a formal business meeting."
    example: "- T\u00f4 com a maior larica. Podia [comer um boi] agora."
