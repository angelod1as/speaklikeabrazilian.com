      This is a very common expression that means bored, tired. The literal translation is something
      like "my scrotum (or balls) is full of this". It means you cannot take it anymore. Like when
      you are bored on a rainy day, watching a bad movie, or tired of working.
      
      Used by both men and women.
    example: |
      - O Johnny n√£o vem hoje de novo.
      - [Caralho](/c/caralho/)! Estou de **saco cheio** dele e das faltas dele.
