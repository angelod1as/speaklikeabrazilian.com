      “De boa” can be used as answer for “Beleza?”. Or you can use it to refer to someone who is in a good situation,
      or everything is OK, where it has the same meaning as “no worries”. 
    example: |
      - [Véi](/v/véi), [cê](/c/cê/) acha que ele vai repetir de ano?
      - Que nada, ele [tá](/t/tá) **de boa**."
