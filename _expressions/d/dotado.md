      This expression has dual meaning. Someone who is “dotado” (masculine)
      or “dotada” (feminine) is someone who is blessed, or gifted. It could
      be someone who is really good at soccer or math. That person would be
      “dotado (a)”.

      But when used in the masculine (dotado) it can mean that that man is
      hung, with a big dick.
    example: |
      - Nossa, que menino **dotado**!
