  - definition: "Usually used by young people, \"Deitar\" is used as a verb. It actually means lie down, but it can be used when talking about a really good performance on a test, presentation or a game. For exemple: You just finish a test, and your friend asks how did you go on the test, if you're sure you got a A+ you can say \"Deitei na prova\"."
    example: "Person1 - Como foi a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o do trabalho?\r\nPerson2 - Deitei!\r\n\r\nPerson1 - Est\u00e1 preparado para a prova?\r\nPerson2 -Vou deitar nessa prova!"
