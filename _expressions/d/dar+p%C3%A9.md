  - definition: "\"Dar p\u00e9\" literally translates to \"Give foot\". It can be used when you are entering a pool, and it is shallow or not deep enough to drown you. Sometimes there are swimming pools with different depths, and someone might tell the other \"At\u00e9 aqui d\u00e1 p\u00e9\", that means that the other person can walk until that point without having to swim. \n\nThis expression can also be used to indicate that a situation is safe, or that something is going to work."
    example: "- Voc\u00ea acha que um novo sal\u00e3o de beleza neste bairro vai dar p\u00e9? \n- N\u00e3o sei, pizzarias e sal\u00f5es de beleza \u00e9 o que n\u00e3o falta por aqui."
