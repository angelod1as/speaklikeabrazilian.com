  - definition: "You use \"p\u00e9 de <fruit/vegetable>\"  to name a fruit tree or a vegetable plant. So a orange tree would be a \"p\u00e9 de laranja\", and in the same way, a lettuce plant would be a \"p\u00e9 de alface\". \n\nSome fruits/vegetables also have special names. An orange tree can be a \"p\u00e9 de laranja\" or a \"laranjeira\". You are good saying both of them."
    example: "\"Estranho \u00e9 gostar tanto do seu All Star azul\nEstranho \u00e9 pensar que o bairro das Laranjeiras\" (All Star - Nando Reis)"
