      This one is a bit tricky to explain. One translation could be
      "can, cannot", or "that is not permitted/allowed, but…"

      The "poder" in the expression is from the verb normally translated as
      "to can", but in this case the meaning is "to permit".
    
      It is used to describe a situation where something is not permitted
      or not allowed. But regardless, people still do it anyway.
    example: |
      - Eu achei que não podia ir no mercado sem máscara?!
      - É. **Poder não pode** né.
