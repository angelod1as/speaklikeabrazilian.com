  - definition: "Literally \"For English to see\". It means something that is intended only to keep appearances. For example, when a company keeps a department of innovation even though they don't need it, just to keep appearances."
    example: "- Aquela empresa comprou dois escrit\u00f3rios novos na Berrini?\r\n- \u00c9, mas v\u00e3o fechar tudo no ano que vem, voc\u00ea vai ver. \u00c9 s\u00f3 pra Ingl\u00eas ver."
