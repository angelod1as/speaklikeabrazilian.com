      This expression means the same as “I got it”, “Leave it to me“. It is
      used when someone is telling another person that the situation is under
      control, or that the person can go ahead since everything is going to
      be alright.
    example: |
      - [Mano](/m/mano/), você tem certeza que quer bater esse pênalti?
      - Ih, **pode deixar**. [Tá](/t/tá/) comigo tá com Deus!
