  - definition: "We say that something is \"pra Ingl\u00eas ver\" when it was created only for the sake of appearances, just for show. According to TeclaSAP website:\r\n\r\nThis odd expression dates back to the nineteenth century, when Brazil and England mutually agreed to combat the illegal black slave trade from Africa. This created a real dilemma for Brazil. On the one hand, Brazil owed Britain many favours and a lot of money, but on the other hand the entire economy of the country was based on slave labour, particularly on the coffee plantations, crucial to the Brazilian economy at the time. The solution was for Brazil to pass laws, but not to enforce them. A good example of this practice was a law passed in 1831 to end the slave trade into Brazil. This actually only took effect in 1852. In other words it was \u2018just for the English to see\u2019."
    example: "- Os sinais positivos da economia brasileira n\u00e3o s\u00e3o apenas para ingl\u00eas ver. S\u00e3o avan\u00e7os reais e verific\u00e1veis.\r\n\r\n- Turista joga guimba de cigarro no ch\u00e3o e recebe multa 'para ingl\u00eas ver'"
