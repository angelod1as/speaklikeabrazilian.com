  - definition: "Probably this could be interpreted as \"Scumbag\" or \"Douchebag\". At least it could be used in the same manner. The translation for this is \"Dick in the ass\". You can say that someone is a \"Pau no c\u00fa\", if he/she is annoying, or is always causing trouble."
    example: "- Voc\u00ea \u00e9 o maior pau no c\u00fa!"
