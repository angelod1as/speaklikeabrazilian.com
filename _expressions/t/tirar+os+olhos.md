  - definition: "Take your eyes out of somewhere/something/somebody/etc. That's what you say when you want someone to stop desiring something. Like when someone is staring at you girl's ass. \n\nUsually it is said quite fast, and may sound like tirar os z\u00f3io."
    example: "- Ae [merm\u00e3o](/m/merm%C3%A3o/), [co\u00e9](/c/co%C3%A9/)? D\u00e1 pra tilhar os olhos da minha [mina](/m/mina/)? \n\n- Ih, pode tirar os olhos que essa torta \u00e9 s\u00f3 minha."
