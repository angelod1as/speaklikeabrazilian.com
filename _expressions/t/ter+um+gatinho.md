  - definition: "To have a kitty.\r\nSame as \"have a cow\" in English (to be very worried, upset, or angry about something) although the idea of \"having a cow\" seems much worse than \"having a kitty\", it is used for the same purpose. \r\n"
    example: "- Fiquei muito nervosa, quase tive um gatinho!\r\n- Nossa, ela quase teve um gatinho (de t\u00e3o brava)!"
