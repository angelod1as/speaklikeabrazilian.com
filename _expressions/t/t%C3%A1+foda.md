  - definition: "This expression means that it is not easy, that it is complicated. \"T\u00e1\" is a informal abbreviation for the correct verb conjugation \"est\u00e1\", and \"foda\" could be translated to hard, or fucked.\r\n\r\nUsed to describe that something is not easy. It could be a relationship, your job, the car maintenance, etc."
    example: "- Como vai a vida Seu Jo\u00e3o?\r\n- T\u00e1 foda. N\u00e3o p\u00e1ra de aparecer problema."
