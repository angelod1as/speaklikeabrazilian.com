      A mispelling and play with words. The correct would be "Tiro ao alvo", which simply translates to
      "target shooting". But it became popular in the old samba "Tiro Ao Álvaro" by Adoniran Barbosa.
      Álvaro is also a name, though not very common.

      Táubua de tiro ao Álvaro
      Não tem mais onde furar
