      A bad word similar to whore, slut. Now with a more pejorative meaning, but in some context
      or in old texts, it can mean tramping, wandering, or rambling person.
      
      When used with a man, normally it is associated with lack of work, laziness, and not with
      a sexual connotation.
    example: |
      - Nossa, mas a Neide é muito **vagabunda**. Ela fugiu com o marido da Jacinda, você acredita?
