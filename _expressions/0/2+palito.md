      Something that is going to be easy and quick to get done. You can use that to
      say that you will be right back, or that you won't take long doing something.
      The plural is not always correct, most of the time people say “2 palito”, but
      “2 palitos” (or “dois palitos”) can also be used.
    example: |
      - Vou até a padaria e já volto.
      - [Tá](/t/tá), mas nãp demora.
      - **2 palito** [mano](/m/mano)"
