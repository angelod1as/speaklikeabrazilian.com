  - definition: "I insist. It is a very polite way of saying that you insist on doing some favor. \r\n\r\nYou can use it when you want to let someone else to sit on your place (like on buses, metro, etc) and s/he denies saying that she isn't tired or doesn't need.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when you volunteer to do something and others say that you don't need to. You just say \"Fa\u00e7o quest\u00e3o\", or \"Eu fa\u00e7o quest\u00e3o\", and they will understand that you really mean it."
    example: "- Ih! Esqueci o boleto l\u00e1 em cima!\r\n- Pode deixar que eu pego.\r\n- Ah, n\u00e3o precisa n\u00e3o. Deixa pra l\u00e1.\r\n- Pode deixar. Fa\u00e7o quest\u00e3o."
