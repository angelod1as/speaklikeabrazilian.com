  - definition: "A \"redneck\" who goes to the beach for a day, brings his own food and has no consideration for anyone else around.  He/she generally are the typical light-skinned irritating day tourists that crowd the beaches in Brazil.\n\nIt has turned into a term to describe people who are inconsiderate to others and don't want to fit in."
    example: "Those farofeiros who are always eating chicken with farofa, make so much noise, don't clean up after themselves and have no consideration for other people!\n\nJo\u00e3o is such a farofeiro, he could care less about anyone else around him!"
