      In Brazil before you are boyfriend and girlfriend, you can be
      *“**ficantes**”*. The concept is similar to a hookup
    
      When you meet someone in a bar, night-club, bookstore, etc., and
      you hook up with that person, in Portuguese we use the verb
      *“**ficar**”*.
    
      So a *ficante* is a person that you are hooking up with, without
      anything serious. A person that you are just *“ficando”*.
    example: |
      - O menino que você estava ontem, é algo sério?
      - Nada, só **ficante** mesmo.
