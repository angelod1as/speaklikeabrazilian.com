      When someone has, or is with “fogo no cú” it means the person cannot hold themselves,
      is hyperactive, or just looking for something to do when they are supposed to stay quiet.
    example: |
      - Vamos brincar de bola?
      - Não.
      - Vamos pular corda?
      - Não. E pára de ficar com esse **fogo no cú**.
