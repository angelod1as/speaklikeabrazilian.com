  - definition: "There are two means (or more):\r\n1) When you are doing (or will do) something boring, it is not enjoyable! Normally associated with riding, or parties, but can be used for any situation.\r\n2) when the soccer player can't kick the ball, he tried to kick, but for disability his feet can't touch the ball."
    example: "1) Eu n\u00e3o vou no anivers\u00e1rio dele (nessa festa/nesse passeio/nessa viagem), vai ser uma furada!\r\n2) voc\u00ea viu a furada que ele deu na bola?! Era s\u00f3 ele chutar e fazer o gol!"
