title: Yay! Speak Like A Brazilian has now a brand new blog!
category: blog
---
It has been raining in Sao Paulo since Friday. Perfect weather for writing 
computer code. Our task this weekend was fix minor issues in Speak Like A 
Brazilian (SLBR), continue working on refactoring parts of the code in order 
to Open Source it, and add a blog to SLBR.

We are also working on **web and mobile applications and games**. Stay tuned, we 
guarantee you'll like what's coming next.

#### Help us to help foreigners learning Brazilian Portuguese

By adding expressions to SLBR you are helping millions (or at least all of them 
with Internet connection) of foreigners to learn our local expressions. 
There is **no registration required** for adding expressions to SLBR, and we take 
our [privacy policy]({{site.base_url}}privacy) very seriously (basically, we'll share 
any personal information with any other service or partner, and we hate spammers from 
the bottom of our hearts).

You can also [spread the word about SLBR](http://www.facebook.com/SpeakLikeABrazilian) 
to your friends, tell us if you know someone who would like to advertise here, 
or drop us a message if you want to join the moderators team.

#### How it works

All expressions added by visitants go through a moderation queue. Our moderators 
review the expressions and make sure no offensive content is published, adds links 
to other expressions, review the tags and finally approve/reject the expression.
