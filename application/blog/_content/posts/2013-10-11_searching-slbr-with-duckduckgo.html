[DuckDuckGo](http://duckduckgo.com) is a search engine that doesn't track you and has different features 
than other engines. Like *bangs*. Bangs allows you to search Google (with **!g**), 
Google Maps (with **!maps**), Wikipedia (**!wiki**) and now Speak Like A Brazilian 
with the **!slbr** bang. 

![DuckDuckGo]({{assets.ddg_logo}})

Try now searching your favorite expressions in Speak Like A Brazilian with queries 
like !slbr malandro, !slbr baranga or !slbr cerveja. You will be redirected to SLBR web site 
instantly. 

What is cool is that you can browse [DDG's bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html) 
and search all kinds of contents, using many different tools in one single place. 
And [nothing is tracked](http://donttrack.us/), no ads and no hidden cookies.

Have fun!
