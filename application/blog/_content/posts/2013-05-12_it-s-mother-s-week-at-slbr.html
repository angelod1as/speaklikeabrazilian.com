This week we'll be featuring **expressions used by mothers in Brazil**. So if you are 
a foreigner in Brazil, and have small (or even big) kids, hopefully you'll find some of 
these expressions useful!

We'll translate and share with you expressions like *"Leva o guarda-chuva"*, 
*"Procurou que nem o seu nariz"*, *"Faça o que eu falo, não faça o que eu faço"*, 
*"Leva uma blusa"*, *"Já comeu?"*, *"Não fale com estranhos na rua"* and others.
