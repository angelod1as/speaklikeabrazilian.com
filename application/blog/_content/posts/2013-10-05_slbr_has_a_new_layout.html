Today we have published our **new web site**, with a brand new layout and more features. 
In the previous version, although there was a field to subscribe to the word of the 
day, we didn't really stored the e-mails subscribed. 

*DISCLAIMER: this post has a lot of geek/nerd terms*

The main reason behind this was that whe the code was written we prioritized other 
parts, and since we didn't have enough expressions yet, there wouldn't be a way to 
send the **word of the day e-mail**. But now that we have almost *300 expressions* and 
almost *300 people* that liked our [FaceBook page](http://facebook.com/SpeakLikeABR), 
we believe the web site has visitors interested in learning a new Brazilian Portuguese 
expression everyday (even if we have to repeat a few ones).

The **new layout** is now based on Flat design, using [FlatStrap](http://flatstrap.org) and 
[JQuery](http://jquery.org). Furthermore, 
the source code has been published as Open Source. You will notice we haven't 
written anything for the past months, but that's exactly because we have been 
working on this new version and in an Android application.

Another change is the **search engine**. The old version used a full text on binary 
tables in MySQL (we had a dummy table only for queries). It generated duplications 
in the database, and wasn't very efficient (you couldn't use the star operator, 
for instance). The new search mechanism is Sphinx, an Open Source tool that is 
able to create reverse indexes and even mimic MySQL - though we are using the 
PHP client API.

Finally, there are a few things that must be done (finish the moderators area, 
schedule the jobs to send the word of the day, etc) but now we will have more 
time *to blog* and maybe *create videos*. 2014 is almost there, and in the next year 
we have the following goals:

- Increase our community and be able to help more people learning/sharing Brazilian 
Portuguese expressions, words and maybe even some grammar
- Create a video channel with lots of videos with expressions in use
- Increase the number of moderators (SLBR is still being maintained by TupiLabs, but 
that's not our goal)
- Monetize the web site with T-shirts and maybe one or two small ads
- Launch the Android application to Google Play
- Publish a book with our expressions

We hope you will enjoy the new website, and let us know if you are interested in helping 
in any way. The source code is already available -
