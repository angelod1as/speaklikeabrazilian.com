                        <p>Speak Like A Brazilian is a web site that receives contribution from several people. These
                        contributors do not always have the same background, or live near each other. So it is
                        understandable that some content that is valuable for some, may not look correct for others.</p>

                        <p>Your task as moderator is to make sure that Speak Like A Brazilian can receive these
                        contributions as long as they respect gender, sexual preference, religion, race, etc. In
                        other words, as long as the content being published will be well accepted.</p>

                        <p>If an expression contains an example that makes reference to politics, actors,
                        or jokes that only a minority will understand, you can change the example to a more
                        generic example.</p>

                        <p>This way we do not deviate from our goal: teaching and sharing Brazilian Portuguese
                        with the world.</p>
